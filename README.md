## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for chat users.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Send and receive messages instantly.
- **Chat Rooms**: Users can join or create chat rooms for group conversations.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their display names and status.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Flutter
- **Language**: Dart
- **Architecture**: Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
- **State Management**: Provider
- **Backend**: Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore

## Architecture

The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for clear separation between the data, UI, and logic, ensuring scalability and ease of maintenance.

### Key Components:

- **Model**: Handles app data, including user authentication and chat messages.
- **View**: Represents the UI elements such as login, register, and chat screens.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as the intermediary between the Model and View, managing data flow and user interactions.

## State Management

The **Provider** package is used for state management, making the app responsive to real-time updates and user inputs. Provider ensures efficient data handling, especially when interacting with Firebase for authentication and chat messaging.

## Pages and Functionality

### Login Page

- Users can log in using email and password.
- Secure authentication handled by Firebase.

### Register Page

- New users can sign up with email, password, and display name.
- Input validation ensures correct data entry.

### Chat Room

- Users can join existing chat rooms or create new ones.
- Real-time messaging with messages displayed in a list.
- Messages are stored in Firebase Firestore.

### Profile Update

- Users can update their display names and profile information.
- Profile changes are saved to Firebase in real-time.

## Setup

To set up and run the project locally, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd chat-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Set up Firebase**:

   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new Firebase project.
   - Enable Firebase Authentication and Firestore.
   - Download `google-services.json` for Android and place it in `android/app/`.
   - For iOS, download `GoogleService-Info.plist` and add it to your iOS project.

5. **Run the app**:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

   Ensure your Firebase backend is properly set up for user authentication and real-time messaging.
